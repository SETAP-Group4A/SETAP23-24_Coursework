Work in progress need to:


adjust the code at the end of main.py so the connection doesnt terminate immediately

may need to run the psql server on a different port

Used this tutorial for connecting the database https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuQUNHCeKCk&list=RDCMUC7EVSn5inapL20oPSwAwEUg&index=2

1: Clone the repository

2: Install psycopg2 module in vscode- pip install psycopg2 

3: Download PSQL- https://www.postgresql.org/download/

4: While installing PSQL set the password to 1234 and the port to 8080

5: Open SQL Shell app that has just been installed and press enter on all the options and put in the password 1234

6: Copy paste the SETUPdb.sql file into the SQL Shell

7: Run main.py
